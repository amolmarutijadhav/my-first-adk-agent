# Testing Guide: Enhanced Tools-Based Multi-Agent System

## üéØ **System Overview**

You now have an **enhanced tools-based multi-agent system** that uses ADK tools to provide true multi-agent capabilities. This system bridges the gap between simulated multi-agent behavior and true multi-agent architecture.

## üöÄ **How to Test the Enhanced System**

### **Step 1: Start the Enhanced System**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /c/Users/Amol/code/my-first-adk-agent

# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Start the enhanced tools-based multi-agent system
adk web
```

### **Step 2: Test Individual Agent Tools**

#### **Test 1: Technical Agent Tool**
**Input**: "How do I debug this Python code?"
**Expected Response**: Should call the `tech_agent_tool` and return:

#### **Test 4: Hello Agent Tool**
**Input**: "Hello there!"
**Expected Response**: Should call the `hello_agent_tool` and return:
```
üëã Hello Agent Greeting:

Query: Hello there!

Hello there! I'm here to help with general conversation and questions.

1. **Warm Welcome**: Great to meet you!
2. **General Support**: How can I assist you today?
3. **Friendly Chat**: Let's have a pleasant conversation

```

### **Step 3: Test Multi-Agent Collaboration**

#### **Test 5: Complex Query Requiring Multiple Agents**
**Input**: "I need help with a technical project that requires creative marketing"
**Expected Response**: Should call the `agent_collaboration_tool` and return:
```
ü§ù Multi-Agent Collaboration:

Query: I need help with a technical project that requires creative marketing
Collaborating Agents: tech_agent + business_agent

Here's our combined expertise:

**tech_agent Perspective:**
- Specialized insights from tech_agent
- Domain-specific recommendations

**business_agent Perspective:**
- Complementary analysis from business_agent
- Additional considerations

**Combined Recommendation:**
- Integrated solution approach
- Best of both worlds

This collaboration provides comprehensive coverage of your request!
```

## üéØ **What to Look For**

### **‚úÖ Success Indicators**
1. **Tool Calls**: The system should actually call the appropriate tool functions
2. **Agent Identification**: Each response should clearly identify which agent is responding
3. **Specialized Responses**: Each agent should provide domain-specific expertise
4. **Collaboration**: Complex queries should trigger multi-agent collaboration
5. **Consistent Formatting**: Responses should maintain the expected format

### **‚ùå Potential Issues**
1. **Tool Import Errors**: If you see import errors for `google.adk.tools`
2. **No Tool Calls**: If the system responds without calling tools
3. **Wrong Agent Selection**: If the wrong agent responds to a query
4. **Formatting Issues**: If responses don't match the expected format

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue 1: Import Errors**
```bash
# Check if ADK tools are available
pip list | findstr google-adk
```

### **Issue 2: Tool Not Being Called**
- Check the agent's instruction to ensure it mentions calling tools
- Verify the tool descriptions are clear and specific
- Test with very specific queries that match tool descriptions

### **Issue 3: Wrong Agent Selection**
- The routing logic is based on keywords in the user's query
- Try using more specific technical/creative/business terms
- Check if the tool descriptions match your query

## üìä **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] **Technical queries** trigger `tech_agent_tool`
- [ ] **Creative queries** trigger `creative_agent_tool`
- [ ] **Business queries** trigger `business_agent_tool`
- [ ] **General queries** trigger `hello_agent_tool`
- [ ] **Complex queries** trigger `agent_collaboration_tool`
- [ ] **Agent identification** is clear in responses
- [ ] **Response formatting** matches expected format
- [ ] **Tool functions** are actually called
- [ ] **No import errors** occur
- [ ] **System restarts** properly after changes

## üéâ **Success Criteria**

Your enhanced tools-based multi-agent system is working correctly if:

1. **Different queries trigger different agent tools**
2. **Each response clearly identifies the responding agent**
3. **Responses contain domain-specific expertise**
4. **Complex queries trigger collaboration**
5. **No errors occur during operation**

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Testing**

Once testing is complete and successful:

1. **Document any issues** found during testing
2. **Optimize tool descriptions** if routing isn't working correctly
3. **Add more specialized tools** for additional domains
4. **Consider moving to Phase 2** (API-based system) for more advanced capabilities
5. **Share results** and feedback for further improvements

## üìû **Getting Help**

If you encounter issues during testing:

1. **Check the console output** for error messages
2. **Verify your `.env` file** has the correct API key
3. **Restart the server** after making changes
4. **Test with simpler queries** first
5. **Check the ADK documentation** for tool usage
