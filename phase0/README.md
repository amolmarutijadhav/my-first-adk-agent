# Phase 0: Smart Prompt-Based Multi-Agent System

## 🎯 **Phase 0 Overview**

This phase implements a **smart prompt-based multi-agent system** using sophisticated prompt engineering to simulate multi-agent behavior. This is the foundation that demonstrates how a single agent can behave like multiple specialized agents through intelligent instruction design.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

The system uses a **multi-agent orchestrator** that:
1. **Analyzes user input** to understand the topic and intent
2. **Applies routing logic** based on content keywords
3. **Generates responses** in the style of appropriate specialized agents
4. **Maintains agent identification** through consistent formatting
5. **Simulates multi-agent behavior** through prompt engineering

## 🤖 **Available Agents**

### 1. 👋 Hello Agent
- **Purpose**: General greetings and casual conversation
- **Best for**: Welcoming users, small talk, general questions
- **Implementation**: Prompt-based simulation
- **Response Format**: `👋 Hello Agent: [response]`

### 2. 💻 Tech Agent
- **Purpose**: Technical support and programming help
- **Best for**: Programming questions, debugging, technical explanations
- **Implementation**: Prompt-based simulation
- **Response Format**: `💻 Tech Agent: [response]`

### 3. 🎨 Creative Agent
- **Purpose**: Creative writing and artistic projects
- **Best for**: Storytelling, brainstorming, creative writing, artistic concepts
- **Implementation**: Prompt-based simulation
- **Response Format**: `🎨 Creative Agent: [response]`

### 4. 💼 Business Agent
- **Purpose**: Business strategy and professional advice
- **Best for**: Business planning, career advice, professional development
- **Implementation**: Prompt-based simulation
- **Response Format**: `💼 Business Agent: [response]`

### 5. 🔀 Multi-Agent Orchestrator
- **Purpose**: Main coordinator that routes to appropriate agents
- **Best for**: Primary agent for all conversations
- **Implementation**: Smart prompt-based routing
- **Response Format**: `[Agent Emoji] [Agent Name]: [response]`

## 🎯 **Topic Routing Examples**

The system automatically detects topics and routes accordingly:

| **User Input** | **Agent Response** | **Specialization** |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Hello there!" | `👋 Hello Agent: [response]` | General conversation |
| "How do I debug this Python code?" | `💻 Tech Agent: [response]` | Programming help |
| "Help me brainstorm a story idea" | `🎨 Creative Agent: [response]` | Creative writing |
| "What's the best business strategy?" | `💼 Business Agent: [response]` | Business advice |

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Smart Prompt-Based Architecture**
```python
# Multi-agent orchestrator with intelligent routing
multi_agent_orchestrator = Agent(
    name="multi_agent_orchestrator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction="""You are a multi-agent orchestrator that manages a team of specialized agents. Your job is to:

    1. Analyze the user's message to understand the topic and intent
    2. Determine which specialized agent should respond
    3. Provide a helpful response that incorporates the expertise of the appropriate agent
    4. ALWAYS start your response by indicating which agent is responding

    Available specialized agents:
    - hello_agent: General greetings and simple conversations
    - tech_agent: Programming, debugging, technical questions, and system issues
    - creative_agent: Creative writing, brainstorming, artistic projects, and storytelling
    - business_agent: Business strategy, analysis, professional advice, and career guidance

    Routing logic:
    - Greetings, simple questions, general conversation → hello_agent style
    - Programming, code, debugging, technical terms, system issues → tech_agent style
    - Writing, creative, artistic, storytelling, brainstorming → creative_agent style
    - Business, strategy, career, professional, financial, market → business_agent style

    IMPORTANT: Always begin your response with a clear indication of which agent is responding..."""
